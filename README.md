Python Web Browser Automation is an application designed to open multiple Chrome tabs of your choice in less than 5 seconds, making browsing faster and more efficient.

## Why i made this:
I created this Python Web Browser Automation app to simplify my workflow. Logging into my computer and manually opening each tab I need to start working was time-consuming. With this app, a single click opens all the tabs I need automatically, saving time and effort. It's a practical solution that embodies the purpose of coding: making life easier and more efficient.

## The module and framework i work with:
1. Webbrowser
   - open default webbrowser easily
   - Fast and light
2. CustomTkinter
   - Make simple GUI
   - Make interactable GUI
3. AppOpener
   - Opening .exe file
4. Pyinstaller
   - Turn the code to .exe file
   - Wrap all the code into one file
