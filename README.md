Python Web Browser Automation is an application designed to open multiple Chrome tabs of your choice in less than 5 seconds,
making browsing faster and more efficient.

# Why i made this:
I created this Python Web Browser Automation app to simplify my workflow. Logging into my computer and manually opening each tab
I need to start working was time-consuming. With this app, a single click opens all the tabs I need automatically, saving time and effort.
It's a practical solution that embodies the purpose of coding: making life easier and more efficient.
